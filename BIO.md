First and foremost, NaBTF!

For me it's about people and not technology.

I am about distilling simplicity from complexity.

I am currerntly a Sr. Distinguished Engineer at Capital One.

I am a programmer/developer who focuses on Cloud and Container technology adoption.

As a technology leader and serial pundit, I use my love of learning and teaching, and my knowledge and thought-leadership in cloud and container technologies, to assist organizations to discover and develop extensible and sustainable solutions.

I enable technology transformation by developing existing staff talents, designing reusable architecture patterns, and incubating new software capabilities.
